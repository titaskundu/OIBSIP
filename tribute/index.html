        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Lionel Andrés Messi (born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who
            plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the Argentina national team.Messi
            relocated to Spain from Argentina aged 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17
            in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and
            in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish
            football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi
            winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During the
            2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while
            establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second
            for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form
            during the 2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic
            second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona
            in 2018, and won a record sixth Ballon d'Or in 2019. Out of contract, he signed for French club Paris
            Saint-Germain in August 2021, spending two seasons at the club and winning Ligue 1 twice.</p>
